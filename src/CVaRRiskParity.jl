# CVaRRiskParity

CVaRRiskParity is a package designed to calculate long-only weights for
CV@R Risk Parity and Risk Budgeting portfolios,
given arbitrary simulations of relative losses of each asset.

Currently, it implements a cutting plane algorithm
with dedicated initialization for numerical stability and performance,
allowing for several thousand simulations.
It also implements two stochastic gradient algorithms,
taking samples from a user-defined function that allows for
arbitrary distributions.
One is based on the Lagrangian reformulation of the problem,
while the other is a projected version into the feasible domain.

"""
    cvar_rbp(B::Vector{Float64}, alpha::Float64, rel_losses::Array{Float64,2}; tol::Float64=1e-6, maxiters::Int=1000)

Compute the investment weights on the assets in order to build a
CV@R-`alpha` risk budgeting portfolio given risk appetites in `B`
and a matrix of relative losses in `rel_losses`.
This matrix has size  (|B|, nsamples), so that each column corresponds
to a sample of relative losses, and each row to a given asset.

The algorithm stops after reaching a provable optimality gap within
(both absolute and relative) tolerance `tol`, or after `maxiters` iterations,
if it fails to converge.

Returns (failed, w) :: Bool, Vector{Float64}

For more details on the algorithm, see `cutting_planes`.

Compute the investment weights on the assets in order to build a
CV@R-`alpha` risk budgeting portfolio given risk appetites in `B`
and a function `loss_sampler()` that returns a sample vector
of relative losses (from their joint distribution).

The algorithm stops after `maxiters` iterations, that is, after sampling
`maxiters` vectors of relative losses.

Returns w :: Vector{Float64}
